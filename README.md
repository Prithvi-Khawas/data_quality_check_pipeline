This project automates the process of checking the quality of data in a system. It uses Apache Airflow to schedule and manage tasks that run at specific times. The main goal is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and ready for use.

The pipeline is designed to:

Check if the data meets the required quality standards (such as completeness, accuracy, and consistency).
Run automated checks to catch any errors or issues in the data.
Provide logs and reports of the data quality checks for easy monitoring.
By using Docker, the entire pipeline is containerized, making it easy to deploy and run anywhere. The project is also version-controlled using Git to keep track of changes.
